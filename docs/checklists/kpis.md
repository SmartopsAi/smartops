# KPI Definitions
- **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recovery = mean(duration from incident start to healthy state)
- **FPR**: False Positive Rate = FP / (FP + TN)
- **F1**: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
- **Auto-heal %**: (# incidents resolved without human intervention) / (total incidents)
- **Inference latency (p95)**: Detect+Diagnose end-to-end ≤ 5s
- **SLA**: Availability ≥ 99% under test conditions
